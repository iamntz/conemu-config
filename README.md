conemu-config
=============

Just copy the `conemu.xml` file into `C:\Program Files\Conemu` (near to `ConEmu.exe`) and you are all set.

### What's up with this?

1. Default theme is nicer (hint: [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized))
1. Nicer colors overall
1. It will open PowerShell as default (hint: install [posh git](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/12/13/better-git-with-powershell.aspx))
1. `Ctrl+1` ... `Ctrl+9` will switch tabs
1. Once you open the console, you can quickly hide it with `Ctrl+Shift+~`. Same shortcut it will toggle it after that.
1. Text encoding is _right_ For some reasons, basic install is messing with composer. Now it just works.

And probably some other tweaks as well.
